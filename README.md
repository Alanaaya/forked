# What is this?
Couldn't sleep, saw a tweet: 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds">@kentcdodds</a> Now wouldn&#39;t it be cool, if you could go into a repo in your node_modules and run `npm fork` and it would fork it on github.</p>&mdash; Merrick Christensen (@iammerrick) <a href="https://twitter.com/iammerrick/status/717194650629476353">April 5, 2016</a></blockquote>

made it so.

# Getting Started

Install the module:
```
$ npm i -g forked
```

Dive into some random node module:
```
$ cd node_modules/react
```

Run the command:
```
$ fork
```

If it worked, you should be able to see the fork on GitHub.
